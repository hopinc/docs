  'LLHLS (Low-Latency HLS) allows you to deliver live, low-latency streams to
  global audiences over HTTP.'

Historically, HLS has favored stream reliability over latency, however back in
2019 during WWDC, Apple announced their own extension to the protocol: LLHLS,
which can bring stream latency down to 1-2 seconds.

## Overview

Regular HLS has an average global latency of 20-30 seconds, which is extremely
poor by today's standards and definitely not realtime, which is what we strive
to achieve in our entire product line.

Low Latency HLS can bring this latency down to as low as 1-2 seconds. Apple
achieved this by focussing on 4 major components:

### Reducing Publishing Latency

In the regular HLS protocol, encoded stream segments are meant to be about 6
seconds long before getting added to the HLS playlist. This already adds a
_base_ latency of 6 seconds - plus, clients could request the HLS playlist ~5.9
seconds after the previous segment publish (worst case), which would mean they
would be delayed from the live broadcast by about **12 seconds**.

LLHLS solves this by publishing small parts (~250ms each) of the main segment to
the playlist before the main segment itself is ready.

### Optimizing Delivery

HLS works through HTTP polling - clients send a HTTP request to fetch the HLS
playlist, which contains information about the latest published segments, from
the server. In regular HLS, this is one URL: playlist.m3u8 (for example) -
because of this, extra latency is added due to edge CDNs caching the playlist
contents for the `TTL` (time to live). Also, clients could request segments at
the "worst-case" segment window: just before a new HLS segment is generated.

LLHLS allows clients to discover segments more quickly in 2 ways:

#### Pre-empted Playlist Requests

Clients can request playlists from the server _before_ the actual segment is
generated. The server will then hold on to the request and then, when the
playlist updates, it responds back with the immediate latest segment. The client
will now be aware of the latest segments in half the round-trip time.

#### Unique Playlist URLs

To prevent CDNs from caching old playlist entities, LLHLS assigns _different_
playlist URLs per update, which prevents CDNs from caching stale entities and
allows for more efficient content delivery.

### Eliminating Segment Round Trip

In LLHLS, when clients make a pre-empted playlist request, they also send a PUSH
tag - this tells the server to, when returning the HLS playlist, _push_ the
latest segment to the client at the same time, so the client doesn't have to
make a second round-trip.

### Delta Playlist Updates

In regular HLS, playlists are always returned in full - it returns segments that
the client is already aware of. This makes sense for the client's _first_
playlist request, but not for subsequent requests.

In LLHLS, the full playlist is only returned for the client's _first_ request.
For subsequent requests, only the delta between the latest playlist and their
previous request is sent back - this usually fits into a single packet (MTU) of
data, which increases network forwarding efficiency.

## Hop's LLHLS Implementation

There's no doubt that LLHLS is the gold standard of today's livestreaming
protocols; for Pipe, we implement the raw protocol and serve it across our edge
network.

However, thanks to our [Leap](./internals/leap) protocol, which is a
WebSocket that all frontend SDKs use to signal with Pipe (and Channels!), we're
able to gain greater insight across all realtime viewers from a latency and
network environment standpoint. Leap keeps a running heartbeat with clients,
which we use to calculate round-trip-time (RTT) between our edge and the client.

### Playback Sync

> Please note that the following feature is experimental and heavily subject to
> change

While LLHLS is great, users on slow networks may receive older playlists due to
network latency, and therefore be de-synced with other viewers. This isn't
acceptable for certain applications, such as watch parties, which expect users
to react to the same content.

By default, Pipe will optimize your LLHLS stream for "low latency", and won't
take sync into account. However, you can use the `llhls_config` object when
creating a Room to fine-tune your playout options.

To achieve better playout sync between users, you can use the `wcl_delay`
parameter in your `llhls_config`. This will now optimize your stream for
**sync** rather than **low-latency**, and while still miles better than legacy
HLS, adds a base latency of 5 seconds to your delay from live. This latency can
increase from 5 seconds up to your "wcl_delay" parameter, regardless of your
users' internet conditions. Users with network conditions unable to meet the
"wcl_delay" parameter will be desynced from other users.

The `wcl_delay` parameter is basically a way to tell Pipe how much you're
willing to delay your live broadcast in favor of providing a more synced
playback for users with bad network conditions. `wcl_delay` stands for "Worst
Case Latency Delay".

On frontend clients, Leap sends periodic telemetry data about the users' current
playback environment, including currently synced HLS playlist. If we detect that
more than 5% of your room is behind the current playlist, we do 2 things:

- Start sending older playlist data (adding latency up to the specified
  wcl_delay), and
- Adjust the playback rate of other clients to eventually let them sync with the
  new active delay
