## Downloading the CLI

The CLI will use the same script to download the CLI as the
[download page](/cli/overview) does. This means that you can use the same
environment variables to configure the download. One of the environment
variables is `HOP_VERSION` which is used to specify the version of Hop to
download. If you don't specify a version it will download the latest version.
The versions can be found on the
[releases page](https://github.com/hopinc/cli/tags).

#### Example:

```bash
$ export HOP_VERSION=v0.1.46
$ curl -fsSL https://download.hop.sh/install | sh
```

or in a one-liner:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://download.hop.sh/install | HOP_VERSION=v0.1.46 sh
```

<Note>You **must** specify the `v` prefix when specifying a version.</Note>
