Using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) is a great way to deploy a python application. Using it on Hop is very easy and can be done in a few steps.

## Demo

<Note>
	We have already made a repository for you to use. You can find it{' '}
	[here](https://github.com/hop-examples/python_gunicorn)
</Note>

### Preparing your application for Hop

1. Gunicorn needs a config file to run. We will create a file called `gunicorn.conf.py` and add the following code to it. If you already have a config file, make sure to have this appended to it.

<div style={{"paddingLeft": "35px"}}>

```python
bind = "0.0.0.0"
```

If you are going to expose this service through a gateway, the application needs to be bound to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

</div>

2. If you are using a dockerfile (if not skip to #3), make sure to add the following line to it.

<div style={{"paddingLeft": "35px"}}>

```dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "[WSGI_APP]"]
```

Where `WSGI_APP` is of the pattern `$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)`.
For example for:

```python
# main.py
def app(environ, start_response):
    # your code here
```

The command is `CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app"]`

</div>

3. If you are not using a dockerfile, upon deploying your project to Hop, make sure to add the following under "Advanced Options" -> "CMD"

<div style={{"paddingLeft": "35px"}}>

```bash
gunicorn [WSGI_APP]
```

Like so,

</div>

4. All set! Enjoy your python application on Hop!
