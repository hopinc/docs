	Ignite provides containers as a service. Think about it like Kubernetes,
	without the hassle and boilerplate that comes with it. Ignite also offers the
	option to attach GPUs to your containers.

### Channels

Realtime messages & events, delivered globally in milliseconds.

	Realtime, stateful objects that live on the edge. Use them to store realtime
	data or to send message events to Channel subscribers with a simple call to
	our SDK. Very configurable and feature-rich; use them to create anything from
	a realtime stock ticker to a full-featured chat platform.
