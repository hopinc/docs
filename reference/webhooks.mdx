## Webhook Basics

### Creating Webhooks

You can create a webhook within our [console](https://console.hop.io/project/settings/webhooks) or through our [SDK]()

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion icon="terminal" title="Create a webhook through the Console">
	
	Navigate to Project Settings > Webhooks and select the events as follows

    <Frame>![](/images/webhooks-create.webp)</Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Create a webhook through the SDK">

```ts TS
import {Hop} from '@onehop/js';

const projectToken = 'ptk_xxx';
const hop = new Hop(projectToken);

const webhook = await hop.project.webhooks.create(
	'https://example.com/webhook',
	['ignite.deployment.container.metrics_update'],
);
console.log(webhook.id);
```

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Editing a Webhook

After creating a webhook, you can edit the events and endpoint that the webhook is associated with. Please refer to the [Events](#events) section for more information on the events that you can listen to.

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion icon="terminal" title="Edit a webhook through the Console">

    	Navigate to project settings and select the webhook you wish to edit

        <Frame>![](/images/webhooks-edit.webp)</Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Edit a webhook through the SDK">

```ts TS
import {Hop} from '@onehop/js';

const projectToken = 'ptk_xxx';
const hop = new Hop(projectToken);

const webhook = await hop.project.webhooks.edit('webhook_xxx', {
	events: ['ignite.deployment.container.metrics_update'],
	webhookUrl: 'https://example.com/webhook',
});

console.log(webhook);
```

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Regenerating Webhook Secret

You can regenerate the secret associated with a webhook. This will invalidate the previous secret, and you will need to update your application to use the new secret in order to correctly verify the webhook payload.

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion
		icon="terminal"
		title="Regenerate webhook secret through the Console"
	>

    	Navigate to Project Settings > Click the three dots of your chosen webhook > Regenerate Secret

        <Frame>![](/images/regenerate.webp)</Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Regenerate webhook secret through the SDK">

```ts TS
import {Hop} from '@onehop/js';

const projectToken = 'ptk_xxx';
const hop = new Hop(projectToken);

const secret = await hop.project.webhooks.regenerateSecret('webhook_xxx');

console.log(secret);
```

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Deleting a Webhook

After creating a webhook, you can delete it at any time. This will instantly invalidate the webhook, and Hop will no longer send any requests to the endpoint associated with the webhook.

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion icon="terminal" title="Delete a webhook through the Console">

    	Navigate to Project Settings > Click the three dots of your chosen webhook > Delete Webhook

        <Frame>![](/images/webhooks-delete.webp)</Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="terminal" title="Delete a webhook through the SDK">

```ts TS
import {Hop} from '@onehop/js';

const projectToken = 'ptk_xxx';
const hop = new Hop(projectToken);

await hop.project.webhooks.delete('webhook_xxx');
```

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Webhook Payload

### Request Headers

With every webhook request sent to your endpoint, Hop will include a signature header. This will help you verify that the request is coming from Hop, and not a malicious/third-party source.

Header Example:

```http
X-Hop-Hooks-Signature: 86EBE7F54A92C809CDF8F3DC6536C566A1C074F9B001E9118DF7EC433BE435E7
```

### Request Body

When an event occurrs that the webhook is listening to, Hop will send a POST request to the endpoint you specified when creating the webhook. The request body will contain a JSON object.

Body Example:

```json
{
	"webhook_id": "webhook_MTkzMDU5MTE4NzcyNDA0MjI3",
	"project_id": "project_MTY1MjU5NTk1NTAwNTY4NTc3",
	"occurred_at": "2023-10-02T15:46:13.323Z",
	"id": "event_MTkzMzkwODU2OTQwODkyMjgx",
	"event": "ignite.deployment.container.metrics_update",
	"data": {
		"metrics": {
			"memory_usage_percent": "0.07",
			"memory_usage_bytes": 393216,
			"cpu_usage_percent": "0.00"
		},
		"container_id": "container_MTkzMDc3MjExODczMDc5MzAx"
	}
}
```

### Verify Webhook Payload

To verify the webhook payload to ensure that it is coming from Hop, we provide a utility function in the @onehop/js SDK.

```ts TS
import {verifyHmac} from '@onehop/js';

const validHmac = verifyHmac(
	stringedJSONBody,
	webhookSignatureHeader,
	webhookSecret,
);
```

Similar to the Stripe SDK, you can also construct an event to get type safe access to the webhook payload.

```ts TS
import {constructEvent} from '@onehop/js';

try {
	const event = constructEvent(
		stringedJSONBody,
		webhookSignatureHeader,
		webhookSecret,
	);

	console.log(event.id, event.data);
} catch (err) {
	// handle error ("Invalid signature")
}
```
