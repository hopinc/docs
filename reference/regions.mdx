Regions are physical points of presence where you can host and use Hop services.
Some Hop products allow you to use multiple regions at once, some automatically
utilize all regions.

We anycast one /24 block from all our regions and extra edge points of presence,
to provide edge TLS termination and live video distribution: `185.167.182.0/24`

## Regions

| Region ID | Location           | Hostname Base    | Subnet Base | Upstream ISPs       | Peering            |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| us-east-1 | Ashburn, VA (DC10) | us-east-1.hop.io | 10.1.0.0/16 | Cogent, GSL, HE.net | IX & PNI available |

## Peering Policy

We operate an **open** peering policy with our customers and partners. You can find our PeeringDB [here](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/26508).

### IX Peering

If you are present within a shared internet exchange, we're happy to peer with you - free of charge.

Please reach out to `noc@hop.io` and provide:

    * Your company name & a short description
    * Your ASN
    * The IX location
    * Your IP address on the IX

### PNI

If you need a dedicated connection to Hop at one of our points of presence, you can purchase a private network interconnect (PNI). This is currently handled at a case-by-case basis, so please reach out to `noc@hop.io` to discuss your requirements. Make sure to provide your preferred port size. We support `1Gbps`, `10Gbps` and `40Gbps` ports at most regions.
