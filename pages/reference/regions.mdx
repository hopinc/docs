# Regions

Regions are physical points of presence where you can host and use Hop services. Some Hop products allow you to use multiple regions at once, some automatically utilize all regions.

We anycast one /24 block from all our regions and extra edge points of presence, to provide edge TLS termination and live video distribution: `185.167.182.0/24`
