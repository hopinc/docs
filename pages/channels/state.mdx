# Channel State

As well as transient messages, channels can be used as a store for realtime, stateful and persisted state. You can think of it like a realtime database attached to every channel.

Channel state is stored under `state` in the Channel object. State is a key/value map, which you can provide when creating a Channel, and then update later on. All subscribers are able to access Channel state. When state is updated, all subscribers will be synced with the latest state object. You can also listen to the individual state update events with the client SDK.

## Updating State

You can update channel state from the server side SDK libraries or the API:

<Code>
```ts
// Get a channel by its ID
const channel = await hop.channels.get('channel_0');

/**
 * Option 1: Rewrite the state.
 * The existing state is passed as the first arument to Channel#setState
 */

channel.setState(s => ({ ...s, name: "My Channel" }));

/**
 * Option 2: Update or add variables
 * This operation will only effect the variables you specify.
 * The rest of the state will remain unchanged
 */

channel.patchState({ name: "My Channel" });
```
</Code>

Either of these operations will update the connected clients in realtime.

## Clearing State

<Code>
```ts
// Get a channel by its ID
const channel = await hop.channels.get('channel_0');

// Clear the state. This will set the state to an empty object ({})
channel.clearState();
```
</Code>


## Reacting to State Changes on the Client

You can use our client-side SDKs, like Hop.js to listen to and react to channel state changes. Clients will automatically receive state updates to all channels they subscribe to.

To listen to individual state updates, you can listen to `stateUpdate`:
```ts
hop.channels.on('stateUpdate', (channelId: string, state: unknown) => {
	// do something
});
```

To get the initial state of all channels when clients connect, you need to listen for the `init` event.

```ts
hop.channels.on('init', (d: ChannelInitialization) => {
	// all channel objects are stored under d.channels
});
```

### Usage with React
If using React, you can use the `useChannelState` hook:

<Code>
```tsx
const Price = () => {
	/**
	 * `state` will be null until the client is connected
	 * this will attempt to subscribe the client to the specified channel
	 * if they are not already subscribed (you can disable this)
	 */
	const state = useChannelState("usd_prices");

	if (!state) {
		return <h1>Loading</h1>;
	}

	return <h1>BTC Price: {state.btc}</h1>;
}
```
</Code>
