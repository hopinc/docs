Welcome to Hop's API documentation & product overview.

Interfacing with Hop is possible over our REST API, or with prebuilt SDKs for certain supported languages. These docs cover both our REST API and all server side SDKs.

# Overview

We design and produce high-quality, reliable and low-latency products meant for the real-time era that we live in today. Our current product line consists of 3 products: Ignite, Pipe and Channels.

## Product Summary

### Ignite

> Deploy any kind of application. Leave the infrastructure to us.

Ignite provides containers as a service. Think about it like Kubernetes, without the hassle and boilerplate that comes with it. Ignite also offers the option to attach GPUs to your containers.

Need to stream live video to clients? Think Pipe. From 1 to 1 million live viewers, Pipe will handle the scale for you, no intervention is needed.

### Channels

Realtime, stateful objects that live on the edge. Use them to store real-time data or to send message events to Channel subscribers with a simple call to our SDK. Very configurable and feature-rich; use them to create anything from a realtime stock ticker to a full-featured chat platform.
