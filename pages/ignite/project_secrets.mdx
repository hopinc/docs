# Project Secrets

Project secrets act as a global secure secret store for each project on Hop. Secrets can be referenced in Ignite deployment configs and will automatically be populated when a container starts.

Secrets can be **created**, **updated** and **deleted** through the API, CLI, SDK or console, however, they cannot be viewed.

## Secret Names

Secret names are limited to 64 characters in length, must be alphanumeric (with underscores) and are automatically uppercased.

üìù Secret name regex, for your convenience: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,64}$`

## Managing Secrets

### Creating or Updating a Secret


With the CLI, you can manage secrets with the `hop secrets` command:

```sh
hop secrets set <secret_name> <value>
```

### Deleting a Secret

CLI:

```sh
hop secrets rm <secret_name>
```

## Using Secrets

### In Hop Deployments
When creating a deployment or individual container, you can set environment variables that reference project secrets. Their values will automatically be updated when you update the secrets.

Every field where you'd usually put an environment value is compatible with secrets - you can just use `${SECRETS.NAME}` (where `NAME` is the secret key name) and Hop will automatically replace it with the value when a container starts.

#### Usage with `hop deploy`

When using `hop deploy`, you can specify environment variables with `-e` or `--env`, so: for example, if I wanted to reference a project secret named `REDIS_URI` in my deployment, I'd execute the following command:

```bash
hop deploy --env REDIS_URI="${SECRETS.REDIS_URI}"
```

#### Usage with Console

When creating a deployment, or when using the **Environment** tab in your deployment, you can set environment variable values to secret keys:
<br/>
<Image src={hopEnv1}/>

#### Usage with API

When setting environment variable values on API requests, you can just refer to secrets like you would with the CLI: `${SECRETS.NAME}`
