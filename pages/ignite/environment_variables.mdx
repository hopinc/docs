# Environment Variables

Environment variables act as a variable set outside your Ignite deployment on Hop. Environment variables can be referenced in Ignite deployment configs and will automatically be populated when a container starts. 

Environment variables can be **created** on deployment, **deleted** with the console, and **viewed** with the CLI, console, and API.

Environment variables can be any string, in addition to a secret. For example, a Secret can be used as an environment variable.

## Environment Variable Names

Environment variables are limited to 64 characters in length, must be alphanumeric (with underscores) and are automatically uppercased.

üìù Environment variables regex, for your convenience: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,64}$`

## Using Environment Variables

### In Hop Deployments

When creating a deployment or individual container, you can set environment variables - the values will then automatically be updated.

#### Usage with `hop deploy`

When using `hop deploy`, you can specify environment variables with `-e` or `--env`, so: for example, if I wanted to reference an environment variable named `TOKEN` in my deployment, I'd execute the following command:

```bash
hop deploy --env TOKEN=VALUE
```

#### Usage with Console

When creating a deployment, or when using the **Environment** tab in your deployment, you can set environment variable values.

#### Usage with API

You can set environment variables on an API request: `${env.NAME}`

Using [Hop's JS SDK](https://docs.hop.io/sdks/client/js):
```tsx
import {API} from '@onehop/js';

await hop.ignite.deployments.create({
			version: '2022-05-17',
			name: 'redis',
			image: {
				name: 'redis',
				auth: null,
				gh_repo: null,
			},
			container_strategy: 'manual',
			type: API.Ignite.RuntimeType.PERSISTENT,
			env: {
				TOKEN: 'VALUE',
			},
			resources: {
				vcpu: 0.5,
				ram: '128MB',
				vgpu: [],
			},
			restart_policy: API.Ignite.RestartPolicy.ALWAYS,
		});
```
