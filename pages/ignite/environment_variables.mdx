# Environment Variables

Environment variables act as a variable set outside your Ignite deployment on Hop. Environment variables can be referenced in Ignite deployment configs and will automatically be populated when a container starts.

Environment variables can be **created** on deployment, **deleted** with the console, and **viewed** with the CLI, console, and API.

## Environment Variable Names

Environment variables are limited to 64 characters in length, must be alphanumeric (with underscores) and are automatically uppercased.

üìù Environment variables regex, for your convenience: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,64}$`

## Using Environment Variables

### In Hop Deployments

When creating a deployment or individual container, you can set environment variables - the values will then automatically be updated.

#### Usage with `hop deploy`

When using `hop deploy`, you can specify environment variables with `-e` or `--env`, so: for example, if I wanted to reference an environment variable named `TOKEN` in my deployment, I'd execute the following command:

```bash
hop deploy --env TOKEN="${env.TOKEN}"
```

#### Usage with Console

When creating a deployment, or when using the **Environment** tab in your deployment, you can set environment variable values:

<br />

<!-- <Bleed>
	<Image src={hopEnv1} />
</Bleed> -->

#### Usage with API

You can set environment variables on an API request: `${env.NAME}`
