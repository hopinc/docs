# Overview

We design and produce high quality, reliable and low-latency products meant for the realtime era that we live in today. Our current product line consists of 3 products: Ignite, Pipe and Channels.

## Product Summary

### Ignite

> Deploy any kind of application. Leave the infrastructure to us.

Ignite provides containers as a service. Think about it like Kubernetes, without the hassle and boilerplate that comes with it. Ignite also offers the option to attach GPUs to your containers.
