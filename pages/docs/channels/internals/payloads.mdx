# Payloads

We split payloads up into 2 categories: **Control** and **Service**. All payloads (from and to Leap Edge) must follow the Leap Edge encapsulating payload type:

### Encapsulating Payload Type

| field | type    | description  |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| op    | integer | opcode       |
| d     | object  | message data |

**The payloads documented below are defining what goes inside the `d` (data) field.**

## Control

Payloads related to setting up & maintaining a connection with Leap Edge.

### Opcode 1: Hello

opcode: `1`  
direction: `rx`

Payload received from Leap Egde when connecting. This payload contains information needed for the client to set up and maintain a connection to Leap Edge.

| field              | type    | description                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| heartbeat_interval | integer | the interval in milliseconds which the client should send heartbeat packets at |

### Opcode 2: Identify

opcode: `2`  
direction: `tx`

Client should send this after receiving Opcode 1: Hello. This should contain identifying information about the client, including the LE token.

| field      | type   | description                |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| project_id | string | the project id             |
| token      | string | the `leap_token_xxx` token |

### Opcode 3: Heartbeat

opcode: `3`  
direction: `both`

Client should send this every x milliseconds, a repeating interval defined in Opcode 1: Hello (heartbeat_interval). The repeating payload does not need a data field, however, the socket may send this opcode with a `tag` field to the client - if this is received, the client needs to immediately send this opcode back with the `tag` field in the data object.

| field | type    | description       |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- |
| tag   | ?string | the heartbeat tag |

### Opcode 4: Heartbeat Ack

opcode: `4`  
direction: `rx`

Client will receive this opcode when any heartbeat is sent. If client was responding to a tagged heartbeat, then the `tag` field and an extra `latency` field will be included in the heartbeat acknowledgement.

| field   | type     | description           |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| tag     | ?string  | the heartbeat tag     |
| latency | ?integer | total round trip time |

## Service

Payloads for interacting with Hop realtime services through Leap Edge, through channels. All channel payloads are sent and received over Opcode 0: Dispatch. Other than Op 0, the events documented in this section are describing the contents of the Dispatch message.

**Important:** All Hop services expose a default set of interface events which relate to the subscription and control of the service. The service will also implement its own events to transmit actual service data, and these events do not conflict with the default interface events documented below. You will need to check the documentation of the service for a full list of events dispatched from that specific service.

### Opcode 0: Dispatch

All interaction, to and from Hop Channels are transmitted through this Opcode.

opcode: `0`  
direction: `both`

| field | type      | description                                                                              |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| c     | ?string\* | channel id                                                                               |
| u     | ?bool\**   | whether this is a unicast message (only sent to this connection, not the entire session) |
| e     | string    | dispatch event code                                                                      |
| d     | object    | event data                                                                               |

\* the `INIT` payload will contain a `null` channel ID  
\** Exists on received payloads only (not required for tx)

---

All payloads documented below specify the contents of Opcode 0: Dispatch. For outgoing messages, this documentation assumes you have already populated the `s` (service identifier) field with the relevant service ID.

### `INIT`: Initialization

e: `INIT`  
direction: `receive`

When successfully authenticating with the socket, you will receive this payload which details your authorization scope, token metadata, as well as channels the token is already subcribed to.

| field            | type      | description                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cid              | string    | connection id                                                       |
| connection_count | integer   | how many times this leap token is connected to the Channels service |
| metadata         | ?object   | token metadata, if applicable                                       |
| scope            | string    | one of `project` or `token`                                         |
| channels         | channel[] | list of subscribed channels                                         |

### `SUBSCRIBE`: Create Channel subscription

e: `SUBSCRIBE`  
direction: `send`

Subscribe to the specified channel. If you do not have permission to subscribe to the specified channel, then you will receive a `SUBSCRIPTION_REJECTION` event.

> `d` (event data) can be null

### `AVAILABLE`: Channel Became Available

e: `AVAILABLE`  
direction: `receive`

The service has become available to this Leap session.

### `UNAVAILABLE`: Channel Became Unavailable

You have been unsubscribed from the service, potentially with an error attached.

e: `UNAVAILABLE`  
direction: `receive`

| field      | type    | description                                       |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| graceful   | boolean | if the channel was expected to become unavailable |
| error_code | ?string | the error identifier                              |

### `STATE_UPDATE`: Channel State was Updated

e: `STATE_UPDATE`  
direction: `receive`

| field | type   | description          |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------- |
| state | object | the new state object |

## Channel Availability Errors

You can be disconnected from services for a variety of reasons. When you get disconnected, an `UNAVAILABLE` event will be sent down. If the service became unavailable errenously, an `error_code` string will be part of the event data. This section documents what those error codes mean.

### `NOT_GRANTED`

The Leap Token used to authenticate the socket connection does not have the permission grant required to authenticate with the attempted channel.

### `UNKNOWN`

The channel you attempted to message does not exist or you are not subscribed
