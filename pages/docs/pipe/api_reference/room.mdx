# Rooms

Rooms are Pipe's abstraction of streams. You should create a new Room for each new live broadcast. Rooms will automatically delete after 10 minutes of no input stream. You can also delete them programatically through our API or SDK.

## Room Object

The full Room object returned by our API

| field | type | description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | string | hop-generated room ID |
| name | ?string | optional room name |
| ingest_protocol | string | one of: rtp, rtmp, srtp |
| delivery_protocols | string[] | an array of supported delivery protocols (llhls, webrtc)  |
| join_token | string | room join token |
| ingest_endpoint | string | room ingest endpoint (stream to this!) |
| ingest_region | [region](/docs/reference/regions) (string) | the region where the primary ingest is hosted|
| llhls_config | ?[llhls_config](/docs/pipe/protocols/llhls#llhls-configuration-object) | custom LLHLS configuration options |
| webrtc_config | // TODO: @alii ping me once finished with rtc config in sdk | custom WebRTC configuration options |

## Creating a Room

You can create a Pipe Room through our server-side [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onehop/client) or our REST API.

<Code>
```ts
const room = await hop.pipe.createRoom({
	name: "My Stream", // optional room name
	ingest_protocol: "rtp", // rtp, rtmp or srtp
	delivery_protocols: ["llhls"], // llhls and webrtc are permitted,
	/**
	 * optionally specify ingest region
	 * if not specified, closest region will be matched based on caller IP geolocation
	 */ 
	region: "us-east-1"
})
```
</Code>


## Deleting a Room

Please note that this will cause the ingest server to terminate your connection. This will also trigger the "CLOSED_REMOTELY" connection state on the frontend clients.

<Code>
```ts
// delete by ID
const id = "pipe_room_xxx";
const room = await hop.pipe.deleteRoom(id);

// or, delete from room class
const room = await hop.pipe.getRoom(id);
void room.delete();
```
</Code>
