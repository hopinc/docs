# Rooms

Rooms are Pipe's abstraction of streams. You should create a new Room for each new live broadcast. If marked with `ephemeral`, Rooms will automatically delete after 10 minutes of no input stream. You can also delete them programatically through our API or SDK.

## Room Object

## Creating a Room

You can create a Pipe Room through our server-side [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onehop/client) or our REST API.

<Code>
```ts showLineNumbers
const room = await hop.pipe.rooms.create({
	name: "My Stream", // optional room name
	ingestProtocol: "rtmp", // rtmp or rtp
	deliveryProtocols: ["llhls"], // llhls and webrtc are permitted,
	ephemeral: true // set your rooms to ephemeral if they're single-use
})
```
</Code>

## Deleting a Room

Please note that this will cause the ingest server to terminate your connection. This will also trigger the "CLOSED_REMOTELY" connection state on the frontend clients.

<Code>
	```ts showLineNumbers // delete by ID const id = "pipe_room_xxx"; const room =
	await hop.pipe.rooms.delete(id); ```
</Code>
