import {Code} from '../../components/code';

# Client Implementation

You can use our client (frontend) SDKs to easily implement Pipe into your product.

## Frontend Packages

`@onehop/client`: The core library used by all other framework-specific packages. Can also be used independently.  
`@onehop/react`: Our React-specific implementations for Pipe and Channels.

## Integrating Pipe with a React App

### Installing dependencies
Start off by adding both of our frontend packages to your project
<Code>
```sh
# Using npm
npm i @onehop/client @onehop/react

# Using yarn
yarn add @onehop/client @onehop/react
```
</Code>

### Initializing the Hop SDK

Grab your **project ID** from the [Project Settings page](https://console.hop.io/project/settings).

You should call the `init` function outside of a React component. For example, in your application's entrypoint file:

<Code>
```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { hop } from "@onehop/client";

import App from "./App";

hop.init({
	projectId: "project_xxx" // TODO: replace with your project ID
})

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
</Code>

### Integrating Pipe with React Hooks

The `@onehop/react` package exposes a collection of React hooks which allow you to easily implement product features into your app. We'll focus on `usePipeRoom` in this section.

#### `usePipeRoom`

`usePipeRoom` takes in an object as it's first and only argument, consisting of `joinToken` and `ref`, where `ref` is a [React reference](https://reactjs.org/refs-and-the-dom.html) to a video element.

Let's jump into an example bare-minimum component:
<Code>
```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { usePipeRoom } from "@onehop/react";

const joinToken = "prjt_xxx"; // TODO: replace this with a real Pipe join token

export function Livestream() {
	const videoRef = useRef(null);

	const room = usePipeRoom({
		joinToken,
		ref: videoRef
	});

	return (
		<>
			<button disabled={!room.canPlay} onClick={() => videoRef.current?.play()}>
				play
			</button>

			<video ref={videoRef} />
		</>
	)
}
```
</Code>

As you can see, Pipe allows you to provide your own video element - Pipe just hooks into it and controls the video source and live scrubbing. This gives you flexibility to use any player wrapper or implement the video element however you want.

`usePipeRoom` returns the following object:

| field | type | description |
| - | - | - |
| live | boolean | whether the current room is live or offline |
| canPlay | boolean | whether the room is able to play the stream |
| susbcription | string | one of: available, unavailable, non_existent |

## Integrating Pipe with Vanilla JS

<Code>
```ts
import { hop, pipe } from '@onehop/client';

// TypeScript only — declaring that `node` is a variable
// that exists, and is a DOM Video element
declare const node: HTMLVideoElement;

const client = hop.init({
    projectId: 'project_xxx',
});

const joinToken = 'join_token_xxx';

client.subscribeToPipeRoom(joinToken);

client.getRoomStateMap().addListener(map => {
    const room = map.get(joinToken);

    if (
        !room ||
        room.subscription !== 'available' ||
        !room.connection.llhls?.edge_endpoint
    ) {
        console.log('Not ready:', { room });
        return;
    }

    pipe.mount(node, room.connection.llhls.edge_endpoint);
});
```
</Code>
