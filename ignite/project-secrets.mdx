  'Project secrets act as a global secure secret store for each project on Hop.
  Secrets can be referenced in Ignite deployment configs and will automatically
  be populated when a container starts'

Secrets can be **created**, **updated** and **deleted** through the API, CLI,
SDK or console, however they cannot be viewed.

## Secret Names

Secret names are limited to 64 characters in length, must be alphanumeric (with
underscores) and are automatically uppercased.

üìù Secret name regex, for your convenience: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,64}$`

## Managing Secrets

## Using Secrets

### In Hop Deployments

When creating a deployment or individual container, you can set environment
variables that point to project secrets. Their values will automatically be
updated when you update the secrets.

Every field where you'd usually put an environment value is compatible with
secrets - you can just use `${SECRETS.NAME}` (where `NAME` is the secret key
name) and Hop will automatically replace it with the value when a container
starts.

#### Usage with `hop deploy`

When using `hop deploy`, you can specify environment variables with `-e` or
`--env`, so: for example, if I wanted to reference a project secret named
`REDIS_URI` in my deployment, I'd execute the following command:

```bash
hop deploy --env REDIS_URI="${SECRETS.REDIS_URI}"
```

#### Usage with Console

When creating a deployment, or when using the **Environment** tab in your
deployment, you can set environment variable values to secret keys:

<Frame>![](/images/hop-deploy-env-1.webp)</Frame>

#### Usage with API

When setting environment variable values on API requests, you can just refer to
secrets like you would with the CLI: `${SECRETS.NAME}`
