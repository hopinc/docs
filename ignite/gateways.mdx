  'Gateways allow you to expose your Hop deployments to your project or the

There are 2 types of gateways: Internal or External. External gateways expose
your deployment to the internet under a protocol of your choice, e.g. HTTP.
Internal gateways expose your deployment to your project by giving you an IP
address and customizable internal domain to use.

Currently, both gateway types
[round-robin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)#Round-robin_scheduling>)
requests between containers. In the future, there will be more fine grained
controls for load balancing requests.

## Creating a Gateway

You can create a gateway using the Hop Console or the Hop CLI.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Console">
1. Navigate to the Gateways tab in an Ignite deployment:

<Frame>![](/images/hop-gw-demo-1.webp)</Frame>

2. Click on the "Create Gateway" button in the top right:

<Frame>![](/images/hop-gw-demo-2.webp)</Frame>

3. You will be presented with a modal:

<Frame>![](/images/hop-gw-demo-3.webp)</Frame>

Here, you can select the gateway type and target port.

Gateway type can be either:

- External, or
- Internal

At the moment, external gateways only support HTTP(S), so there's no option to
select the protocol yet.

The target port should be the port your app listens on. The gateway will load
balance requests between containers on the target port. HTTP gateways will
automatically handle external HTTP and HTTPS termination on the correct ports
(80 & 443), so you don't need to run your application on these ports.

4. Click **Create Gateway**.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CLI">
To create a gateway interactively, run the following command:

```bash
hop gateways create [--project <project-namespace>]
```

This will take you through the steps to set up a gateway on a deployment.

You can also create a gateway non-interactively by passing the following flags:

```sh
hop gateways create \
  --type <type> \
  --target-port <port> \
  --project [namespace]
```

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Adding Custom Domains

By default, every external gateway gets assigned it's own `.hop.sh` domain,
generated using the deployment name. You have the choice to update this
subdomain to something not taken already, or you can add your own custom
domains.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Console">
1. Head over to the "Domains" page inside your gateway.

<Frame>![](/images/hop-gw-demo-4.webp)</Frame>

2. Here, you can manage the `.hop.sh` domain as well as add your own custom ones.
   To add a custom domain, click on the Attach Domain button in the top right of
   the page.

3. You will be presented with this modal, where you should enter your desired
   domain.

<Frame>![](/images/hop-gw-demo-5.webp)</Frame>

4. Click **Next**.

After this, you will be required to create a CNAME record for your previously
entered domain pointing to Hop.

5. Details about this record will be shown on screen in a modal after entering the domain. You should add this record to your DNS provider.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CLI">

```sh
hop domains attach [gateway] [domain]
```
