title: 'Port Forwarding'
description: 'Using the CLI, you can port-forward deployments to access them securely without having to expose them to the public internet.'
---

If you haven't already, install the CLI as documented [here](http://localhost:3001/cli/overview).

## Initiate the tunnel

You can open a tunnel between your deployments and local machine via `hop fwd` - then select the local/remote ports to open.

<Accordion title="Without hostames">
    To tunnel your deployment without host entries 
    ```bash
        hop fwd <deployment-name>
    ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="With hostames">
    To add `<name>.hop` to your hosts file, sudo the tunnel in addition to providing the `--hosts` flag.
    ```bash
        sudo hop fwd <deployment-name> --hosts
    ```
</Accordion>
