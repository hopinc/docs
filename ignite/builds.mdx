description: 'When deploying with GitHub, Hop will automatically infer your build environment and initiate a build for each push to git'
---

Using [Nixpacks](https://github.com/hopinc/nixpacks) (a better alternative to Buildpacks), Hop can automatically detect
the language of your app, removing the need to write a Dockerfile for most cases. If a Dockerfile is detected, it will just be built using regular [Buildkit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/).

## Caching

Docker layers are cached to speed up the build process on a per-deployment basis. As of today, we don't bill for build cache although this may change in the future. Each deployment is assigned a quota of 50GB in build cache - usage can be tracked under the `Resources` tab within the deployment.

## Environment

Your deployment's environment is injected into each build - any environment variables imported during runtime will
also exist during build time.

## Building locally with the CLI

By default, `hop deploy` spins up a server-side builder instance. To use your local machine's cache and compute power to build & push your image instead, append the `--local` flag.
