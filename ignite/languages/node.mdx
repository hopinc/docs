<Note>
	Hop uses [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) for automatic Node deployments. You
	can write a custom `Dockerfile` if you don't want to use Nixpacks.
</Note>

Node.js is detected when you have a `package.json` file in your project. All dependencies found in `packages.json` are installed with either NPM, Yarn, PNPM, or Bun (depending on the lockfile detected).

## Start Command

You can specify a custom start command in your `package.json` file, for example:

```json package.json
{
	"scripts": {
		"start": "node index.js"
	}
}
```

If not specified, then the start command will be inferred based on the environment. Read more on the [Nixpacks documentation](https://nixpacks.com/docs/providers/node).

## Versions

Hop supports the following Node.js versions out of the box:

    * 14
    * 16 (**default**)
    * 18

### Specifying a version

The version can be overridden by:

- Setting the `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION` environment variable, or
- Specifying the `engines.node` field in `package.json`
